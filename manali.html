<img class="Manali_Image_1" src="manali.png" >
<p><h1>Hadimba Temple:</h1>
    Manali has many attractions but the chief centre of interest, historically and archeologically, is undoubtedly the temple dedicated to goddess Hadimba. It has four-tiered Pagoda shaped roof and the doorway is carved with legendary figures and symbols. This temple located amidst wooden forest of deodar is about 2.5 kms from the tourist office. It is a pleasant experience to stroll in the temple complex, which was built in 1533 A.D. A large festival is held here in May.
   
   <h1>Kasol (1640 m):</h1>
    Situated on the bank of Paravati river, Kasol makes a good holiday destination. 42 kms from Kulu, charmingly located on an open space which slopes down to the broad expanse of clear white sand at the Parvati river. The place is well known for trout fishing.
   
   <h1>Rohtang Pass (3979 m):</h1>
    Rohtang pass is 51 kms from Manali on highway to Keylong/Leh. It offers a panorama and spectacular mountain view. The pass is open from June to October each year although trekkers can cross it earlier. It is a gateway to Lahaul Spiti, Pangi and Leh valley just as Zojila pass is a gatway to Ladakh. There are beautiful sights of glaciers, peaks and Chandra River flows down in the Lahaul valley. Slightly to the left can be seen the twin peaks of the Geypan. During summer (mid June to October) regular buses ply between Manali-Keylong/Darcha, Udaipur, Spiti and Leh.
   
   <h1>Solang Valley: </h1>
    13 kms is a splendid valley between Solang village and Beas Kund. Solang valley offers the view of glaciers and snow capped mountains and peaks. It has fine ski slopes. The Mountaineering Institute has installed a ski lift for training purpose. Located here is a hut and guesthouse of the Mountaineering and Allied sports Institute, Manali. Now a few hotels have also come up. The winter skiing festival is organised here. Training in skiing is imparted at this place.
   
   <h1>Vashist Hot Water Springs And Temple:</h1>
    Vashist, a small village located on the left bank of river Beas towards Rohtang pass is worth a visit. It is renowned for its hot springs and temples. Nearby is the pyramidal stone temple dedicated to Vashist Muni. There is another Temple of Lord Ram here. Natural hot sulphur springs with two separate bathing tanks for gents and ladies are always full of tourists. Turkish style showers fitted baths have also been built nearby.
